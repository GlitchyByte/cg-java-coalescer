# Java Coalescer for CodinGame challenges

The Java Coalescer for CodinGame, or JC for short, is a tool that allows you to code in Java, using multiple class files like
a normal app would, when participating in [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/) challenges or competitions.

---
## Run it!

If you want to run from source on any platform, you need at least
[Java 17](https://jdk.java.net).

    ./run jc WATCHED_DIR OUTPUT_FILE

**WATCHED_DIR** Directory where your source code resides. For example, the `src` directory in a project generated by your IDE.

**OUTPUT_FILE** Destination file to be written. This is the file you want to upload to CodinGame. You can use [CodinGame Chrome plugin](https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614), if it still works; or better yet, you can use my [CG Code Loader Chrome plugin](https://github.com/GlitchyByte/cg-code-loader-plugin), which is actually faster and less annoying, but you also need a local server. You can use your own, maybe a python one liner, or my [Quick Http Server](https://github.com/GlitchyByte/quick-http-server).

## What does it do?

It constantly observes `WATCHED_DIR` for changes, and it automatically and properly coalesces all files/classes. Then it tests to see if it compiles, and only then writes `OUTPUT_FILE`.

## Example

Example minimal *Player.java*:

```java
class Player implements Runnable {
    // [[JC::UPDATESTAMP]]

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        final Player player = new Player();
        player.run();
    }

    // [[JC::CODE]]

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // TODO: Your code here.
    }
}
```

Note the two `JC` comments:

* `[[JC::UPDATESTAMP]]` Gets replaced by the time at the moment of
coalescing and an ASCII graphic that makes it evident that the file
has changed.

* `[[JC::CODE]]` **This must exist!** This is the point where all
your other classes are injected. Your classes will automatically be
made `static`, and all imports will be correctly added, with no
duplicates, at the top of the generated file.
